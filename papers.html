    <p class="paper__title"> Background </p>
    <p class="paper__detail"> The Covid pandemic has caused serious effects throughout the corporate world and there has
      been a need to adjust and adapt.
      There has equally been a need to rethink the ideas of corporate social responsibility. Additionally governments
      and society have changed and needed to adapt.
      The effects are still playing out in the world of CSR.
      it is important that we recognise these changes and adapt –
      sharing best practice from around the world and we seek to recover.
      We are in an era of change and this can be expected to change. This is pertinent as we seek to recover as the
      World Health Organisation has already warned that future pandemics are inevitable so we must prepare to face then,
      hopefully in a better way than we have managed with Covid-19. At the same time the United Nations has warned that,
      while the pandemic and effects might be serious, there is a far more serious crisis facing the world and that is
      climate change.
      So we need to recognize the present and future crises and adapt. We need also to focus upon the longer term
      objective of ensuring sustainability.
      Accordingly we have set the theme for this conference as focusing upon social responsibility in the changing era.
      This conference is designed to act as a forum for the debate and analysis of contemporary issues in this broad
      area.
      It is intended to attract people from a wide variety of disciplines and geographic regions for an exchange of
      views.</p>
